                    <p> Before you lies a fascinating visualization, dear visitor—<strong>a breakdown of the popularity 
                        of monstrous creatures over the decades, as reflected in the titles of horror films. </strong> 
                        Each line tells a story of terror, shifting tastes, and the ever-changing fears of humanity.Here 
                        we see the rise and fall of the great creatures that have haunted humanity's dreams. <strong>Once 
                        upon a time, in the early days of horror, ghosts ruled supreme. </strong> Mysterious, intangible, 
                        and steeped in folklore—they were the darlings of terror. <strong>But, as humanity grew bolder, 
                        more... material fears began to take hold. </strong>And finally, <strong>in the 50’s, our Master
                        claims his rightful place! The vampire, elegant and eternal, rose to dominate the decade.
                        </strong> Surely you’ve heard of a certain <strong>Dracula</strong> who contributed to this 
                        surge, no? Yet… as you can see, this dominance was fleeting. Soon, audiences grew distracted
                        by new horrors—<strong>aliens, zombies, even clowns. </strong> Yes, clowns! Can you imagine 
                        anything so… undignified?

                    </p>
                </div>        
                        
                <div class="col-md-12 texttitles11">
                    <p> And then, of course, we have the <strong>witches—always lurking, always waiting for their moment 
                        in the shadows. </strong> And the <strong>aliens, with their cold, otherworldly menace.</strong> 
                        Both fascinating competitors, though I dare say they lack the allure of a finely tailored cape and 
                        a Transylvanian accent.
                        Ah, but here lies the true challenge of our time: the <strong>zombie.</strong> From the 1990s onward,
                        these shambling, brainless husks became the face of horror. Why? <strong>Perhaps because they reflect 
                            the fears of the modern world—pandemics, overpopulation, the loss of individuality. But where is 
                            the grace, the sophistication? Such crude creatures, don’t you think? </strong>
                        Now, between you and me, Dracula does not take kindly to this chart. To think that his kind—the 
                        aristocrats of horror—must share the stage with these upstarts? <strong>It’s enough to make him… 
                            well, bite.</strong>

                <div class="col-md-12 texttitles2">
                    <p> <strong>What’s your favorite killer like? </strong> Ah, that's the question, isn’t it? The 
                        language we use to describe our predators tells us so much about our deepest fears. 
                        <strong>As the decades pass, the word killer rises to dominance.</strong> There’s a steady 
                        progression in its prominence, especially in the 70s. <strong>By the 90s, it peaks—unsurprising, 
                            really. The world was gripped by the sensation of slasher films, and everyone, it seemed, had 
                            a killer in their sights.</strong>
                        But then—ah, how the mighty fall. By the late 90s and 2000s, killer starts to fade in favor of 
                        other descriptors. <strong>A shift, perhaps, toward the more nuanced and sophisticated killer? </strong>
                        Enter the <strong>serial killer, a term that climbs during the 80s and becomes iconic in the 90s and 2000s. 

                        </strong> A killer with method and madness! <strong>One can imagine Dracula, always fond of patterns, watching 
                            with glee as this term ascends. He is, of course, no stranger to serial behavior—though I’d say his taste
                            is far more... refined. </strong>

                        
                    </p>
                </div>    
                
                <div class="col-md-12 texttitles22">
                    <p>And then we see <strong>the slow rise of the stalker, a term that peaks in the 2020s. </strong> It seems the
                        world’s fears have evolved. It’s not just the killer who lurks in the shadows now—it’s the stalker, watching,
                        waiting, obsessing. <strong>Perhaps a reflection of the growing sense of paranoia in our connected world,
                            where privacy is no longer a given. </strong>
                        But there’s one term that really stands out, isn't there? <strong> In the 80s, a new breed of killer 
                            emerges—predators. </strong> 
                        
                        Finally, the <strong>butcher. </strong> A bit of an outlier, don’t you think? It peaks early in the 
                        60s and 70s, then fades away into obscurity. <strong>Perhaps people grew tired of the brute force—looking
                            for something a little more... elegant. Dracula would certainly approve. </strong>
                        
                        So, what do you think, my dear guest? Which killer appeals most to your taste? It seems the world’s
                        idea of horror killers has evolved... perhaps in ways even Dracula did not anticipate.

                    <p> Well, well, well. <strong>It seems horror films don’t just show us the terrors lurking in 
                        the shadows—they also reveal just how bizarre and twisted our desires can be. </strong> As 
                        you can see from this chart, the word <strong>love</strong> has consistently reigned supreme 
                        in horror film titles, almost always at the top of the list. A rather curious choice, wouldn’t 
                        you say? Perhaps it’s not the love we think of—no, no. In horror, love is often <strong>forbidden, 
                            twisted, or downright dangerous. </strong>
                        Then we see <strong>desire</strong> making a strong presence, particularly in the 1950s. Could 
                        it be that post-war anxieties manifested in such yearnings? <strong>Sexy</strong> takes a turn 
                        around the 1970s, and by the 1990s, <strong>erotic</strong> surfaces—how charming. A shift towards
                        more explicit themes, perhaps reflecting a society growing more... liberated in its darkest fantasies?
                        <strong>As always, horror mirrors our strange and unsettling nature. It’s clear that, when it 
                            comes to the things that lurk in our minds, we’re not just afraid—we’re drawn to the bizarre,
                            the taboo, the forbidden. </strong>

                        Here we delve into the most recurrent words associated with the word <strong>KILLER</strong>
                        in movie titles. <strong>And let me tell you, it’s a delightful menagerie of the strange and

                        First off, we see the expected – <strong>serial</strong>, of course, because what’s a killer without a little 
                        pattern of madness? But then we have <strong>crocodile</strong>. Yes, that’s right – a killer crocodile. <strong>And 
                        clown– oh, of course. Who else would we trust to bring joy to our nightmares? </strong>

                        And look! <strong>Driller – because nothing says horror like a killer with a power tool. And let’s not 
                        forget mutant, fire, bees and shrews… Seriously, who decided that shews should be murderers? I mean, 
                        bees are terrifying enough, but shrews? The more you know…</strong>
                        The more you look, the stranger it gets… <strong>It’s truly a carnival of absurdity—just the way horror should be! </strong>

                    <p><strong>Ah, now we’re entering an intriguing comparison —the GIRL and BOY in horror movie titles. 
                        Let’s compare them, shall we? </strong> You’ll find that there’s a fascinating distinction in how 
                        these two are portrayed, and the words associated with them reveal quite a lot about the genre’s 
                        treatment of gender.
                        For the girl, we see words like <strong>zombie, dead, school, murder, and chainsaw.</strong> Her world is 
                            one filled with <strong>danger, death, and the supernatural.</strong> There’s an overwhelming 
                            focus on <strong>things that threaten her—whether it's the undead, murderers, or a world gone 
                                wrong</strong> (hell, machine).

                <div class="col-md-12 texttitles52">
                    <p>  There’s a sense of <strong>victimhood</strong> here, and <strong>little</strong> plays a big 
                        part—<strong>this seems to suggest an image of innocence, perhaps before it is destroyed by the
                            horrors she encounters. </strong> Notice also the mention of <strong>daddy's and snake which
                                indicate twisted relationships and a touch of dangerous sexuality lurking beneath the 
                                surface. </strong>,
                        Now, the boy—oh, he’s got a different tale to tell. Words like <strong>, monkey, incest, lover, 
                            pretty, sick, and stone</strong>,  paint a much stranger and more psychological picture. The 
                            boy’s journey seems filled with <strong>, confusion, desire, and bizarre scenarios</strong>,.
                            There’s a distinct lack of pure danger like the girl’s—no zombies or chainsaws for him. Instead, 
                            the themes are more personal and often disturbing (incest, lover, loneliest). <strong>He’s
                                dealing with more intimate, even grotesque, fears and desires. </strong>
                        The girl’s world is shaped by external threats—monsters and danger—while the boy’s is defined by 
                        internal struggles and taboos. <strong>Would you agree, my dear visitor? It’s quite the reflection
                            of how society’s views of gender creep into the shadows of horror films. </strong>

                        words associated with the word VAMPIRE in movie titles. </strong>
                        This is a topic near and dear to my heart, as no one appreciates the majesty and timeless allure 
                        of the vampire more than I do—particularly my master, Dracula. His presence, his immortality, his 
                        eternal power—these are things that no mere movie title can truly capture. 
                    <strong>But this graph, at least, gives a hint of how others try to capture his grandeur. </strong>
                    <strong>Hunter stands out, naturally—Dracula, of course, has dealt with many hunters over the centuries,
                        but he always stays one step ahead. </strong>  The words <strong> woman</strong> and <strong> mr.
                        </strong>  are classic, speaking to the allure and mystery of my master.
                        Then we venture into more curious territory. <strong> Vegan vampires? Dracula would certainly scoff at 
                        that.  As for assassin and samurai—a bit more action-packed than the grand, dignified elegance my 
                        master prefers, but they do add some flair, I suppose. </strong>
                        Lastly, the words <strong> last, living, and first</strong> reflect the eternal question of
                        immortality—one my master has known for centuries.
                        <strong> Some of these words reflect new takes on the genre, rest assured, Dracula's timeless allure,
                        power, and bloodthirsty nature will never fade. And as his most loyal and devoted servant, I will
                        continue to admire and serve him, forever and ever, with unshakable loyalty. </strong>
